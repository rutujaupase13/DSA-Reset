# DSA-Reset
A fresh restart to my DSA journey — focused on building consistency, improving problem-solving skills, and preparing for upcoming technical interviews.


# 🔁 ReDSA — Restarting My DSA Journey with Consistency

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository marks a fresh restart to my journey in mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Although I had previously solved several problems and built a foundation, I realized that true growth needs **consistency, discipline, and a clear path forward**.

So, I created this repository to:

- Restart my DSA practice with clarity and focus
- Track my daily or regular problem-solving progress
- Build discipline in coding, not just motivation
- Sharpen my logical thinking and coding efficiency
- Prepare myself strongly for upcoming technical interviews

## 💭 Why This Restart?

I believe learning is never a one-time task. It's okay to pause, but important to **come back stronger**. After a brief break, I decided to rebuild my consistency by solving problems again — not for quantity, but for quality and regularity.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

- Problems I’ve solved across various platforms
- Well-organized solutions with comments
- Revisions and notes for tricky concepts
- Progress that reflects not just skills, but my growth mindset

## 💡 Purpose

This repo is my digital notebook — showcasing not only my coding skills, but also my commitment, discipline, and readiness for real-world challenges. It stands as proof that I’m dedicated to **continuous improvement** and **structured learning**.

## 📅 Restart Date: `5th July 2025`

Let this be a meaningful restart.
